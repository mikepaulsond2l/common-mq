## Usage Example

      // delete the message after emitting 'message' event
      deleteAfterReceive: true, 
      
      // SQS queue specific attributes
      attributes: { 
        VisibilityTimeout: '60',
        ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds: '20'
      },
      
      // AWS config
      awsConfig: {  
        accessKeyId: 'ACCESS_KEY_HERE',
        secretAccessKey: 'SECRET_KEY_HERE',
        region: 'us-east-1'
        maxRetries: 10
      }
      
    });
    
    queue.on('ready', function() {
      setTimeout(function() { queue.publish({ task: 'take out trash' }); }, 1000);
      setTimeout(function() { queue.publish({ task: 'wash dishes' }); }, 5000);
      setTimeout(function() { queue.publish({ task: 'sweep floor' }); }, 6000);
    });
    
    queue.on('error', function(err) {
      console.log(err);
    });
    
    queue.on('message', function(message) {
      console.log(message);
    });

### Connecting to a Queue
#### .connect(url [, options])
Connects to a queue using a URL scheme (i.e, provider://hostname/queue).  The optional `options` argument passes provider specific configuration (see [Providers](#providers) section below).  

Returns a reference to a queue.

    var queue = require('common-mq').connect('amqp://localhost/todos');

#### .connect(options)
Connects to a queue using a config/options.  Provider, hostname, and queue name are all passed as properties of the `options` object (see [Providers](#providers) section below).  

Returns a reference to a queue.

    var queue = require('common-mq').connect('amqp://localhost/todos', { 
      implOptions: { defaultExchangeName: '' } 
    });

### Class: Queue
#### Event: 'ready'
Emitted when the queue is ready to publish or start start receiving messages.

#### Event: 'message'
Attaching the first listener to the `'message'` event will automatically subscribe to the queue.  When a message is received from the queue, the `'message'` event is emitted to all listeners.

Arguments:

* message `string|object|Buffer`
* messageId `string`

#### Event: 'error'
Emitted if an error occurs while communicating with the queue or receiving messages.

Arguments:

* error `Error`

#### .publish(message)
Publishes a message to the queue.  The message can be a JavaScript object, a string, or a Buffer.

#### .ack(messageId)
If the queue does not support automatically removing messages (once received by a subscriber), or this option is turned off in the options, you will need to call the the `.ack()` method once you have successfully received the message.  The underlying queue provider implementation will handle deleting or acknowledging the message, depending how that particular queue provider handles this concept.

The `messageId` will be the same as passed by the `'message'` event callback.

### Providers

#### AMQP

#### Amazon SQS
